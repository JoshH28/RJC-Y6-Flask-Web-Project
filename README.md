# RafflesOrders

RafflesOrders is a canteen ordering website created by Raflesians, for Rafflesians.
It allows students to order food and drinks from the canteen during the morning or between periods from the website.
This gives the canteen stall owners more time to prepare food, and can help users to skip the long queues.

This project was adopted from the work done by the Anderson Secondary School Robotics Club, where I worked on this project alongside Lim Chang Jun, Hayden How, Ernest Kiew and more.

For installation of libraries, download pip and enter "pip install" followed by name in requirements.txt.
This website is made with the flask framework in python along with its many other libraries
