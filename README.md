# AndersonOrders

AndersonOrders is a canteen ordering website created by Andersonians, for Andersonians.
It allows students to order food and drinks from the canteen during the morning or between periods from the website.
This gives the canteen stall owners more time to prepare food, and can help users to skip the long queues.

This initiative is founded by the Robotics Club, and is executed by the Coding Group of the club.
Notable contributors are: Mr Nathan, Hayden How, Ernest Kiew, Lim Chang Jun and Josiah Huang
